            I'm Jordan McCollam. Here's a little about me . . . 
            I recently got married and moved to Nashville from California. I was previously a mix engineer / producer in the music
            industry but am now realizing that music feels more like a hobby to me than a career. I want to better benifit the world
            around me and make enough money in the process to support my new family. And that is what brought me to the Vanderbilt
            Coding Bootcamp, where I am now beginning my journey as a coder.

            So this is my first portfolio. By the end of this course I'm sure that this very website you're looking at will have grown into
            something much more impressive than what it initially was. I hope to wow you as you peek into my portfolio and show you that
            I am a hard worker, fast learner, and creative mind for any team or company.

            Now, some fun facts about myself, you know, for kicks and giggles. My wife is actually from the Netherlands. Though her first 
            language is English, she's working on teaching me Dutch. I do play music! I play several instruments but am most fond of my
            Acoustic Guitar. I have a Gibson J-200 for any guitar nerds out there. Let's just say it's a great guitar. Lastly, I have 
            a cool cat named Frankie. And I do mean cool. He's not like those cats who are actually just demon spawns from hell. That's me!
